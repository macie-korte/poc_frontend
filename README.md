Before running the project make sure that you have node.js installed. Angular v15 supports node.js versions: 14.20.x, 16.13.x and 18.10.x.

Also you need to install Angular CLI via this command:
npm install -g @angular/cli

After you clone the project, in the core folder you need to run npm install to install all packages, and then do ng serve command to run the project.

And every time you want to run the project just do ng serve command in the core folder.
